    #{page_object_view}

    <p>Up to this point, we've been able to populate our web UI by directly calling the view. Now say we
       want to populate the form and then verify all of the things we populated.
       The problem is, if we used just the view our code starts to have a very repetitive code smell

    #{using_just_a_view}

    <p>You can imagine that if the form also has the contact's address, phone, email, etc that this becomes a tiresome chore
       to code up. Furthermore, if the application UI changes then you have to manage this code as well.

    <p>To address this issue, we use controllers. The controller's job is to take in a the data you want to use
       and then do the population and verification automatically.
       The view is then parsed for all of its keywords and if a keyword has a model value, then it's used. A controller
       for our web page would look something like this:

    #{controller_view}

    <p>That's really all we have to do. Tell the controller which view to look at and let it handle everything else.
       You can then use it to handle the heavy lifting.

    #{using_a_controller}

    <p>In order to continue you will need to implement the Contact controller like the one above.
       The controller will need to refrence the ContactPage as its view. Be sure to place this controller under both ContactPage and ContactModel so that ruby
       knows how to interpret them.
    }
  end

  document :test_controller_model_and_view, "Controllers", "Linking to Models" do
    %Q{
    #{page_object_view}
    #{controller_view}
    #{using_a_controller}

    <p>In the last example we had a controller connected to a view (page object) and we passed in
    the values we wanted to set. The last thing we can do is also add in a model. When we do this,
    you can still use the controller like we did above OR we can pass the controller no test data
    and use the default model values.

    <p>If this is our model
    #{model}

    <p>We connect it to the controller much like we did for the view
    #{controller_model_view}

    <p>And then we can let the controller generate it's data from the model.
    #{using_a_controller_with_model}

    <p>This is great for the most common use case of "I just need a contact and don't care about the details"

    <p>To continue, make the controller for this test case use the ContactModel in order to populate the fields
       and update the test so that assert_equal matches the model's class name.

    }
  end

  document :test_controller_other_actions, "Controllers", "Editing a Record" do
    %Q{
      <p>In many cases, edit screens are almost identical to the form used to create the business object.
         Because this pattern is so prevalent, an edit is very similar to a create except the navigation to
         the page is different.

      <p>So far we've been ignoring navigation but if we were to put some in place, we'd do that in the
         page object (since that is our interface with the application). Generally search functions are the
         same throught a web application so this is usually some common code mixed into the views.

      #{page_object_view_with_navigation}

      <p>Once we've navigated to the right edit page we populate all of the fields specified, just like in a create

      <p>To continue just update the assertion to true.
