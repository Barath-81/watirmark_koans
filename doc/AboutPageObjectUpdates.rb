    <p>In this test, we've just gotten a new release and a test that used to pass, but now fails.
       We know that the developer has made some changes to the UI so let's look there.

    <p>You should be able to inspect the HTML for any element by right clicking the element*.

    <p>Once you see the HTML you can compare it with the Watir call in the Page Object and
       update it accordingly

    <p>Look at the code for this test case and update it to work with the new UI
